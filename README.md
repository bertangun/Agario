# Agario

You are expected to implement a simple multiplayer network game with the following scenario:

You are controlling a circle and you must survive by eating other online players and
foods. There are some non-foods and foods in the game. Non-foods will poison you and it
will you make smaller. Food will you make bigger and slower. When you eat, you lose speed
in proportion to the value of your food. Game is over when you eat all other players.

## Minimum Criteria:

You are expected to design the game by using java. Below are the minimal criteria:

  Proper object oriented (OO) hierarchy (E.g. non-foods, foods, circle can be implemented that
way. Use concepts of interfaces, abstract classes while designing OO hierarchy)
  Each time your circle color must be change.
  Mouse or Key listeners (Both of them must be control your circle. You can use arrows in the
keyboard and click your mouse to control it.)  
  Minimal GUI elements (Minimal a button, a check box and a text field)
  You need to create online network game. Two can be play the game using different computers.
(You don’t need to use any server. You can connect two computers to each other with Ethernet
cable.)
  You need to show speed, circle weight, time information using gui elements.
  Graphics (Java 2D API usage while designing your graphical elements)
  Animation
  Create a jar file
  High Score (Keep user high scores for only recent games. Show it in a GUI element, e.g. list box.
You do NOT have to save it on disk and load it.)
These are the minimum criteria, you can use more than these. Your application should work
without any errors, so don’t forget to run and check your application.

## Bonus:

  When you eat a food, there is a chance that a power-up will show random place on a screen
in few second and you need to eat that power-up, if it’s not eaten, it will disappear. Certain
power-ups have positive effects, while others have negative, making it important to try to
collect the beneficial power-ups while avoiding the detrimental power-ups.
  Good game experience/pleasure
  Save and Load High Score information to/from disk (minimum criteria for 3 people groups)
  Using multiple Threads
  HTTP download (e.g. download and display of high scores of other people which are set on a
webpage) (minimum criteria for 3 people groups)
  Creating smooth online game.
  Three or more players can be play the game. (You don’t need to use any server. You can
connect three or more computers to each other with Ethernet switch.)

## Limitation:

You cannot use third party libraries in your project.
